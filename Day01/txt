Learning Docker [Day 1] ðŸš€

âœ… Let's learn about the Step-By-Step Docker Installation on Windows

1. Go to the website https://lnkd.in/dr3WtFWn
 and download the docker file.
Note: A 64-bit processor and 4GB system RAM are the hardware prerequisites required to run Docker on Windows 10 successfully.

2. Double-click on the Docker Desktop Installer.exe to run the installer.
Note: Suppose the installer (Docker Desktop Installer.exe) is not downloaded; you can get it from Docker Hub and run it whenever required.

3. Once you start installing, always enable Hyper-V Windows Feature on the Configuration page.

4. Then, follow the installation process to allow the installer and wait till the process is done.

5. After completing the installation process, click Close and restart.

âœ… Start Docker Desktop Tool

âž¡ After the installation process is complete, the tool does not start automatically. To start the Docker tool, search for the tool, and select Docker Desktop in your desktop search results.

âž¡ Before starting the application, Docker offers an onboarding tutorial. The tutorial explains how to build a Docker image and run a container.

âž¡ You are now successfully running Docker Desktop on Windows.
Next, follow the instruction below to install the Docker engine on your system.

âž¡ Go to Docker CLI and run the Docker version to verify the version of Docker installation on the system.

âž¡ Congratulations, Docker Installation on Windows is now done, and now, you are ready to build and run Docker images and containers on the Docker ecosystem.

âœ… If you will receive the WSL 2 installation with an incomplete error or show Docker Desktop is Stopped message when you try to start Docker then follow the steps on the given link to fix this error: https://lnkd.in/dtZ7PsG9


Note: Verification of pulling an image from the docker hub and creating a container from this image on Docker Desktop cover on the next Docker post due to upload videos length of up to 15 Minutes.
