Learning Docker [Day 2] ðŸš€

âœ… Let's learn about the Step-By-Step Docker Installation on Linux & Docker Basic Commands

To start the installation of Docker, we are going to use an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.
To install Docker, we need to follow the steps given below.

Step 1 âˆ’ Log into your system as a user with sudo privileges. Before installing Docker, you first have to ensure that you have the right Linux kernel version running. Docker is only designed to run on Linux kernel version 3.8 and higher. We can do this by running the following command.

Step 2 âˆ’ uname: This method returns the system information about the Linux system âˆ’ uname -a

Step 3 âˆ’ You need to update the OS with the latest packages, which can be done via the following command âˆ’ sudo yum update -y.

Step 4 âˆ’ The next step is to install the necessary certificates that will be required to work with the Docker site later on to download the necessary Docker packages. It can be done with the following command âˆ’ sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates

Step 5 âˆ’ The final step is to install Docker and we can do this with the following command âˆ’ sudo yum install docker â€“y
Here, yum uses the install option to download the Docker image from the Docker website and get Docker installed.

Step 6 âˆ’ Docker Version
To see the version of Docker running, you can issue the following command âˆ’ sudo docker version

Step 7 âˆ’ Docker Info
To see more information on the Docker running on the system, you can issue the following command âˆ’ sudo docker info

Step 8 âˆ’ Status Docker âˆ’ sudo service docker status

Step 9 âˆ’ Start Docker âˆ’ sudo service docker start

Step 10 âˆ’ Verify Docker âˆ’ sudo docker run hello-world

âœ… Docker Commands Cover

âž¡ docker run
Usage: docker run -it -d <image name>
This command is used to create a container from an image

âž¡ docker ps
This command is used to list the running containers

âž¡ docker ps -a
This command is used to show all the running and exited containers

âž¡ docker images
This command lists all the locally stored docker images

Note_1: Verification of pulling an image from the docker hub and creating a container from this image on the Docker Desktop cover at the start of this video then I start how to install Docker on Linux-based OS. Because the last video on how to install Docker desktop on windows' last steps of verification is not added due to 15 min video length limit.

Note_2: You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs so if you have more details about the installation of Docker then visit this link for a better understanding: https://lnkd.in/dnWUSWHa
